You might be a good fit to perform at the 2022 TEDxSFU Conference!\nPrevious performers at TEDxSFU include Royal Oak, LaterDays, and The Escapes. Energizers have included Bettina Rothe and Mara Branscombe.\nReporting to the Director of Events, performers and energizers support the TEDxSFU Conference in retaining audience engagement during intermissions and lunch breaks. Performers and energizers will have 10–20 minutes for their routine, whether that is a talent demonstration or musical performance.\nPerformers and energizers should provide any essential equipment for their routine. TEDxSFU will provide microphones and audio connections to the in-house speakers and recording equipment, however musical performers are responsible for their own instruments and amplifiers.\nIn addition to the TEDxSFU Conference day, performers and energizers must be present for the rehearsal dates prior to the conference, as explained below. Performers and energizers must maintain timely communication with the TEDxSFU Director of Events and Organizing Committee.",

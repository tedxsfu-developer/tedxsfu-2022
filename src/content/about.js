        title: 'About Reflection',
        content: 'Reflection, by definition, refers to a “serious thought or consideration”. This year, TEDxSFU challenges people who dare to reflect on their journeys and the issues surrounding the world. Our present realities have been shaped by the multi-faceted experiences we encounter in life. As we reflect deeply on our past choices, triumphs and struggles, these introspections can present opportunities to change the present and the future for good. We want to hear the innovative and empowering stories of reflection, along with what makes you unique and how your story can inspire others?'

        content: 'In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)',
